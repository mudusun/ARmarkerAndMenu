## Overview
**HoloLensARToolKit** is a successful experiment to integrate [ARToolKit](http://artoolkit.org/) (v5.3.2) with [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us), or generally UWP (Universal Windows Platform).

With fiducial marker tracking provided by ARToolKit, plus the indoor localization of HoloLens, many Augmented Reality applications would be made possible.

This repository contains:
- Wrapper of [ARToolKit5](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5) for UWP
- Unity package to interface the native library
- Some sample Unity scenes to demo the use of them
- Link to camera calibration of HoloLens

## Run the sample
1. Make sure you have [HoloLens development tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/install_the_tools) installed.
	* HoloLens Emulator and Vuforia are not required.
2. Launch [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/), open project folder ```HoloLensARSample```.
3. Import the unity package ```ARToolKitUWP.unitypackage```.
4. Open one of the sample scenes
	* ```Assets/Sample/HoloLensARToolKitSingle.unity```
	* ```Assets/Sample/HoloLensARToolKitCube.unity```
	* ```Assets/Sample/HoloLensARToolKitMulti.unity```
5. Configure HoloLens deployment settings and deploy to HoloLens.
	* See Chapter 4 and 5 of [Holograms 100](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/holograms_100).
6. Prepare the correspondent printed marker of ARToolKit.
	* Marker images are [Here](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5/tree/master/doc/patterns).
	* Make sure the printed marker size is same as configured in Unity.
7. See the effect.
	* **HoloLens clicker** or **air tap** is able to tune the visualization of camera frame.
